Login authentication is a way to verify the identity of users before allowing access to certain parts of a website or web app.I have used HTML for the login form, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for validation and authentication.

Process:

HTML Structure (Login Form):
The basic structure of the login form is created using HTML.
Input fields for username and password and a submit button is included.

Styling with CSS:
CSS is used to style the login form and make it visually appealing.
Colors, fonts, margins, and padding are applied to create a clean design.
The input fields, buttons, and error messages are styled.

JavaScript Validation:
JavaScript functions are written to validate user input before submission.
The username and password fields are not empty that is ensured.

Testing and Refining:
the login form with valid and invalid credentials are tested properly.
Any bugs or unexpected behaviors have been checked.

Final Touches:
Once satisfied with the functionality and design,the login authentication is finalized.
Double-checking has been done for any spelling errors or issues.
The login form works smoothly on different devices and screen sizes.
