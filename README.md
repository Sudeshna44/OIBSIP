A Basic To-Do Webapp helps one to keep track of tasks needed to be completed in time.I have used HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Process:

HTML Structure:
It has been started by creating the basic structure of the To-Do app using HTML.
Input fields have been set up for adding tasks, a button to add tasks and a list to display tasks.
Each task has a checkbox to mark as complete and a delete button.

Styling with CSS:
CSS is used to style the To-Do app and make it visually appealing.
Colors, fonts, margins, and padding are applied to create a clean design.
The task list, input fields, buttons, and checkboxes are styled.

JavaScript Functions:
JavaScript functions are written to handle the To-Do app's functionality.

Task Handling:
When a task is added, it will appear in the list with a checkbox and delete button.
Marking a task as complete will visually indicate that it's done (e.g., strike-through text).
Deleting a task will remove it from the list.

Testing and Refining:
The To-Do app is checked to ensure tasks are added, marked as complete, and deleted correctly.
Any bugs or unexpected behaviors are checked properly.
The design and layout are refined for better usability.

Final Touches:
Once satisfied with the functionality and design,the To-Do app is finalized.
Double-checking is done for any spelling errors or issues.
The app works smoothly on different devices and screen sizes.
