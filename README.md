To create a calculator for the web, we'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator will perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.

Process:

HTML Structure:
The basic layout of the calculator is set up using HTML.
Each button has an onclick attribute to trigger a function when clicked.

Styling with CSS:
CSS is used to style the calculator layout, buttons, and screen.
Styles are applied for a clean and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript Functions:
JavaScript functions are written to handle calculator operations.

Button Click Events:
When a number or operator button is clicked, it should add the corresponding value to the screen.
The clear button resets the screen to zero.
The equals button calculates the result of the expression entered and display it on the screen.

Testing and Refining:
The calculator has been tested to ensure all buttons work as expected.
Any bugs or unexpected behaviors have already been checked.
